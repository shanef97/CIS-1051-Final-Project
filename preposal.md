# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. A webpage for Temple food truck reviews. It would contain the following functionality:
   - the ability to filter by cuisine type, rating, price, etc
   - ratings for each food truck (1-5 stars or S - F tier)
   - the ability for users to submit comments, suggestions, etc to my email
  
2. A professional portfolio webpage (responsive) that would host my resume, professional headshot, snapshot of past projects, etc
   
3. A game where a user is given an umbrella and whose objective is to prevent their walking partner from getting rained on. The game would involve dodging obstacles like tree branches, other pedestrians, and the infamous Broad and Cecil wind tunnel.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
