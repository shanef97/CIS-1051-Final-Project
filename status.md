#### What have you done for your project so far?

I hae built the basic "skeleton" for my project - pages, page sections, and basic styling - with HTML and CSS.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to build the "guts" of my website - that is, the content, the Python scripts, and some more styling.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Getting to learn Flask has been a bit of a learning curve, but no problems otherwise.
